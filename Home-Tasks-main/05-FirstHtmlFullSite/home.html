     <br>
     <p>Coffee is consumed worldwide the industry ranges from the growth, production, and distribution. There are so many different blends, brands, and beans that it can be difficult to understand what can make each cup of coffee different from the other. A blend of coffee is the result of combining two different beans to produce different flavors and strengths. Blends are not standardized in the coffee industry, making it difficult to fully grasp the core differences between cups. In order to define a House Blend coffee, you must first understand the basic components of roasting coffee.The degree to which a coffee bean is roasted is one of the most important factors that determine the taste of the coffee. Unroasted beans (green in color) are put into a roaster and exposed to a high level of heat. When the bean “cracks,” it loses its outer coating and releases the flavor of the bean. The longer the bean roasts, the darker and stronger the bean becomes. When the roasting is complete, the beans can be blended and ground to create distinct flavors and brews.</p>

     <p>In short, yes, the unique flavors and strong aroma make Colombian coffee a fan favorite. So what makes it so special and desirable? When we talk about coffee from specific locations, we typically discuss a traditional method of brewing or roasting. Coffee culture is unique across the number of countries that love coffee all over the world. With Colombian coffee, we aren’t necessarily talking about a method of brewing or roasting, but how the bean is grown. Colombia is actually a near-perfect coffee growing climate, and Colombian coffee produces a specific type of bean that results from the environment. Colombia gets heavy rainfall and the landscape never gets close to falling below freezing temperatures at any time of the year. The tropical location is perfect for growing coffee, and grow it does! There are about 600,000 coffee growers in Colombia, and most of them pick the beans by hand.Of course, a lot can go wrong after the beans have been grown: they still need to be roasted and brewed properly, and an error in these processes can seriously change the taste of a Colombian cup. Nevertheless, when you buy Colombian coffee, you’re always off to a good start.</p>
